1. Don't go into others homes
</h1>
<p style="color: antiquewhite;">
This may be obvious, but PLEASE, do not enter another's house unless they invite you in first. If they offer you food, acept it if you can eat it.
Each home is spread far away from each other, so if you want to vist someone, take a bus and do NOT walk unless it's a short distance. Like I said,
the animals get a bit more restless the furthur out of town you are.

    2. If a women with long black hair approchs you, don't say hi and Run
</h1>
<p style="color: antiquewhite;">
This is a local myth about a women known as the long haired women. It's unsure if she's real, but it is better to be safe than
sorry, right? She attacks by strangling you with her hair, choking you to death. If you do see her, run the oposite direction.
Don't run furthur away from a town, even if it's not the oposite direction. Just, stay safe.

    3. If a new human enters the world, bring them back to Oykot
</h1>
<p style="color: antiquewhite;">
    The new human will be confused on where they are ariving. If you end up finding one, take them back imedietly. Make sure they don't take
    off any acsessories, they are apart of their body now. Please be kind to our new comers. Or else, hehe~
</p>

<h1 style="color: antiquewhite;">
    Now, what if I break these rules?
</h1>
<p style="color: antiquewhite;">
    You will recieve a harsh punishment. You will never be heard from again. No one will remember you.
